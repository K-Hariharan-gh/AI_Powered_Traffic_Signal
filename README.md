# AI_Powered_Traffic_Signal

__Blinks of Signal__\
This project aims to integrate the Artifical Intelligent with the traffic systems. This can the replacement for traditional traffic signals. Whenever the vehicles approches respective lane the signal is turned green. The vehicle detection is done with the help of YOLO detection model. The "Priority rules" has been implemented to cope up with some critical situations.

__Implementation of Signal__\
__<#>__ At first the signal system was created only for single lane. After some upgrading, the four-lane model was implemented.\
__<#>__ To avoid accidents the "Priority rules" are implanted.\
__<#>__ If two vehicle approches two different lanes, the vehicle which reached the model detection range first will have the privelage to go first.\
__<#>__ The lane 1 and 3 will turn green simultaneously, if either of lane has the vehicles. Likewise, lane 2 and 4 are paired together. It's for better time management without comparising the safety on roads. \
__<#>__ The Green signal will be on for 15s then it follows up with yellow for 3s finally reaching the red state, it stays until next vehicles are detected.

__Green lights of Signal__\
__<_$_>__ The time is being utilized on better way on the roads.\
__<_$_>__ The power for shifting the signals while no one is around can be nullified.\
__<_$_>__ The potential accidents due to misunderstood shifting of signals are avoided.\
__<_$_>__ The railway department can make a good use of this model.\
__<_$_>__ Their are prioritizes for the certain situation to avoid conflits.

__Shifting of Signal__\
__<_%_>__ The priority rules needs to be updated for inculding the ambulance, when it is done it will have the most priority among other rules.\
__<_%_>__ This model can be given power to shift not only signal but also the rail tracks in near future.\
__<_%_>__ After all the upgrades and updates, The _Signal System_ will be suitable for both _Roads and Rail Tracks._
